                            “Teaching Support Associates" in the Teach for Change initiative work at the Foundation Assisted Schools in a cooperative and collaborative manner both with the management as well as the teaching faculty and help raise the standard of education in accordance with the overall vision of the Foundation and the Government of Sindh. In the first phase (Academic Year 2016-17), the Foundation engaged a third party namely M/s BPS Pvt. Ltd. and was able to hire Teaching Support Associates (TSAs) from across Sindh. The professional engagement of the Teaching Support Associates (TSAs) is spanned over a period of 02 years and they are initially offered a one-year contract, to be renewed for another year based on their performance. Another 300 potential schools are lined up for the second phase to be initiated in 2019-20.
